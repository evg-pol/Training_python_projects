# Training projects in Python
This repository is a collection of projects that designed to sharpen my skills in Python-based data analysis, covering various data manipulation, visualization, and statistical techniques. These projects were  completed during my enrollment in the Data Scientist Professional Training Course at Practicum by Yandex. This training program has been instrumental in strengthening my practical expertise in data science.
